### File

- [`car-object-unsolved`](Unsolved/car-object-unsolved.html)

### Instructions

- With a partner, spend the next few moments studying the code in the file above.

- Then write code below each comment to log the relevant information about the provided `car` object.

- Using the code from the previous activity as a starting point, create a complete application that meets the following specifications:

- Users can enter keyboard input (letters).

- Each of the car's methods are assigned to a key.

- When the user presses a key, it calls the appropriate function.

- These letters also trigger a global function called `reWriteStats()` that logs the car's make, model, color, mileage, and `isWorking` status to the console.

- **BONUS:** If you finish early, create a brand new object of your own. Slack out a snippet of the code to the class when you are done. Be creative!
